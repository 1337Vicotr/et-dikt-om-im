Information technology, a subject quite divine
And media production, a skill of mine
Together they work like a dream
Helping me to create, or simply gleam
In the world of art and technology, I shine

Information technology, a knowledge true
And media production, a skill that's new
Together they help me to see
The world in a way that is free
Of boundaries and limitations, they renew

Two dear friends, forever they'll stay
Helping me to find my way
Through the maze of life's mystery
They provide the tools for me to see
A path to my dreams, in every way

So I, to the two, am forever grateful
They've helped me to be creative and dutiful
In the world of tech and art
I've found a place that's smart
Thanks to information technology, so beautiful

Information technology and media production
Two dear friends, always in motion
An invaluable part of my journey
To success, they're key
I'm grateful for all they do, that's no folly
