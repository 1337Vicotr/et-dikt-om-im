Information technology and media production
Two dear friends, always
Like some great gate, facilitating for many
For me they are the same, a great help

Information technology, a knowledge master
Media design, networking and artistry
He gives me the tools to communicate with the world
And helps me to understand all that I seek

Media production, a creative design
With cameras, editing programs and concept
He gives me the tools to form my history
And helps me to reach out to a larger public

So I, to the two
Am a grateful combination
These help me to reach my goal
And helps me to escape any wrong self.

Information technology and media production
Two dear friends, always
An invaluable part of my life
And my journey to success
