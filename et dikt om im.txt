Information technology, a boy so bright
Helps me navigate the digital site
Together with media production, a girl so fine
They make my projects shine
In the world of technology, they play their part

Information technology, a field so vast
And media production, a skill that's unmatched
Together they help me to see
The world in a way that is free
Of boundaries and limitations, they surpass

Two dear friends, forever they'll stay
Helping me find my way
Through the maze of life's unknown
They provide the tools to be shown
A path to my dreams, a brighter day

So I, to the two, am forever grateful
They've helped me to be creative and dutiful
In the world of tech and art
I've found a place that's smart
Thanks to information technology and media production, so beautiful

Information technology and media production
Two dear friends, always in motion
An invaluable part of my journey
To success, they're key
I'm grateful for all they do, that's no folly
